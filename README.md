got to learn do-while loop and used nested for loop,
also, a lot of time was spent on understandig different ways to restrict user input to a certain liking.
overall, good exercise.

DONE AND DUSTED!!

implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:

       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########

But prompt the user for an int for the pyramidâ€™s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:

  #
 ##
###

Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int altogether.
